// The completed project should, when executed, do the following:
// 1) Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
// 2) Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
// 3) The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point.
//      -Ties result in zero points for both Players.
// 4) After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.
